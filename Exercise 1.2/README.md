# CF Python First Achievement Exercise 1.2

## Create a structure for recipe_1 
### recipe_1 contains the following keys:
* **name (str)**: Contains the name of the recipe
* **cooking_time (int)**: Contains the cooking time in minutes
* **ingredients (list)**: Contains a number of ingredients, each of the str data type

For the data structure, I would choose to use the dictionary data type for recipe_1. A dictionary allows me to store data in key-value pairs, making it suitable for representing the properties of a recipe. Additionally, dictionaries can store values of various data types, which are necessary for the different types of information needed in a recipe, like the data type list for the ingredients and the data type integer for the cooking time. 

## Create an outer structure called all_recipes for all recipes
For the outer structure all_recipes, I chose the data type list, because lists are allowing for the storage of multiple items/recipes. Lists are also mutable, meaning that recipes can be easily added or removed as needed.
